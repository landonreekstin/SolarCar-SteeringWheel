# SolarCar-SteeringWheel

Manages the driver inputs on the steering wheel and the embedded driver display for the Principia RaXI solar car. Sends driver inputs via CAN to the other modules in the car to control the lights, horn, motors, and battery. Gives driver data on battery and motor status through the touchscreen GUI.

This project is a copy from the private Principia Solar Car repository and excludes library and include files for privacy. I contributed alongside two other developers in coding, debugging, and testing this project.

The project uses the PIO and Arduino libraries to control a Teensy 4.1 microcontroller.
